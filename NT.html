<p></p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1 (17. 3 ounce) box prepared puff pastry</li>

        <li>1 cup chocolate hazelnut spread, such as NutellaÂ®</li>
        
       <li>1 large egg</li> 
        
</ul>


<h4>Directions</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment.</li>
    <p></p>
    <li>Lightly flour a work surface, and roll 1 puff pastry sheet out into a 10x10-inch square; set aside. Repeat with the second pastry sheet.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Spread chocolate hazelnut spread evenly across 1 puff pastry sheet. Carefully lay the second puff pastry sheet directly over top. Trim any uneven edges. Cut the pastry into 10 long 1-inch wide strips using a sharp knife or pizza cutter. </li>
<p></p>
<li>Working with 1 strip at a time, twist each strip of pastry until the strip is twisted along the entire length. Starting at one end, coil strip into a round, tucking the end underneath. Gently set onto the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining strips.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Beat egg in a small bowl with a fork. Brush tops of twists with egg wash using a pastry brush.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 12 to 14 minutes. Let cool on a wire rack.</li>
<p></p>
<li>ENJOY</li>
